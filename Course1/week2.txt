Forming the Right Personality
Objectives
Discuss how product managers can train themselves to adapt their personality to the job
Summarize tips to learn how to share the "right" personality
Variation and diversity
There is no magic formula for hiring a product manager. Variation and diversity are critical in product management to provide multiple perspectives. Product managers should also never assume that their customers have only one view of a product, so it is beneficial to have them come from different backgrounds. For this reason, product managers should learn how to best utilize their skills and talents. For example, if you have a technical background in software, you probably have a good understanding of the development process, and if you have worked in software, you can use that to your advantage. The other side of the coin is personality.

Different perspective
Every product manager brings a different perspective and personality to the job, and you should use this to improve your team and the project's performance. If you have an outgoing person, you can use them to socialize, communicate, negotiate, and network. In some cases, this is easy, for others it can mean work. You may need to train yourself to adapt these personality traits to the job. Others may be more introverted and enjoy immersing themselves in data. They are the type of product managers who excel at research, analysis, and interpretation of data. Product managers are often entrepreneurs.

Good fit for the type of company
There is no right or wrong type of person to be a product manager, there are only good fits for the type of company and product. If you have a passion and a vision, you can use your personality to be successful. When you train your personality for the job, you find out what areas of product management you can excel in. If you want to work for a company that is aware of the issues you care about and your personality is best suited to drive the mission, you might find it rewarding to work for them. If you are a leader, use this as an opportunity to bring teams together that might not otherwise work together.

Leadership
You may have the kind of personality that makes people want to follow your lead. This can be of great value to the product and the company. You may need to spend time learning about leadership, but you should think about how to adapt it to your job. Product managers are often curious and want to develop the best product to fill a gap. Some are focused on growth and have the ability to think beyond the launch. Others show loyalty and take the brand and product very personally.

People known for introspection are able to think deeply about and understand the customer experience. You may want to know your strengths and weaknesses and practice applying your personality to your strengths, but also develop the weaknesses. If you have a hard time leading people or public speaking, develop those areas, and find ways to showcase your other strengths.

Beliefs and values
Finally, your work should always be guided by your beliefs and values. You should believe in the mission and vision of the company. The products should reflect your beliefs and you should believe in the products you manage.

The use of your personality in product management is situational and you should be consistent in your approach. You should know when the right time is to bring out the best of your personality. If the situation calls for strong leadership, then this is the best time to capitalize on it. Maybe the company has an idea of what it wants to do but lacks the enthusiasm or entrepreneurial skills to put it into action.
